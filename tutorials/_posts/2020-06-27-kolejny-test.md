The Motion Sick was an indie rock band formed in Boston around 2006 known for "infectious, upbeat pop"[1] and melancholy lyrics.[2] The band released two full-length albums, Her Brilliant Fifteen (2006) and The truth will catch you, just wait... (2008) as well as a split 7" with Golden Bloom (2010) and an EP of novelty songs (2010).

They sprung into notoriety after being featured as band of the month in SPIN Magazine[3] in early 2006 and were selected as the best unsigned band in Boston by commercial radio station WFNX during the Last Band Standing competition.[4] They also won The Boston Phoenix Best Local Band 2009 honor.[5]

In 2008, the lead single from their second album, "30 Lives" aired extensively on TV stations around the world including MTV, Fuse TV, and MuchMusic.[6] The song and video were noted for featuring a reference to using a video game code (The Konami Code) to get 30 lives to spend with a partner. The music video is a satire of 1950s and 1980s high-school movies and musicals and contains references to Grease, Back to the Future, Weird Science, and others.[7] In late 2008, the song and video were included in several releases of the video game Dance Dance Revolution: DDR X (Arcade game and PlayStation 2) and DDR Universe 3[8] (Xbox 360).

The Motion Sick has been on indefinite hiatus since 2010, reuniting for a one-off show in 2013.[9]
